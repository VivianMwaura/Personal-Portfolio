        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large potatoes (Russet or Yukon Gold)</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil (for frying)</li>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the potatoes (if desired) and cut them into fries. Aim for even thickness for uniform cooking.</li>
            <li>Soak the fries in cold water for at least 30 minutes to remove excess starch (this helps them become crispier).</li>
            <li>Drain the fries and pat them dry with a clean towel.</li>
            <li>In a deep pot or deep-fryer, heat vegetable oil to 350°F (175°C).</li>
            <li>Carefully add the fries to the hot oil in batches to avoid overcrowding. Fry until golden brown, about 4-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Using a slotted spoon, remove the fries and drain them on paper towels.</li>
            <li>While still hot, season with salt and any additional seasonings you like.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce.</li>
        </ol>

    <section id="tips">
        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>For extra crispy fries, double fry them: fry at a lower temperature first, let them cool, and then fry again at a higher temperature.</li>
            <li>Experiment with different seasonings like paprika, cayenne, or parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>For a healthier alternative, you can bake the fries in the oven: toss with a little oil and bake at 425°F (220°C) until golden.</li>
        </ul>
